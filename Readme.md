<b><i>Pharmacy Management System</i></b>
> I have created a system which allows a pharmacy keep stock of available drugs in their database and a software that allows clients (doctor,s) make request of available drugs
#### The repo contains:
* client.py which is the client tkinter script
* main.py which contains the flsk server script
* Templates, static and images folders which contain other essential scripts for the management webapp
